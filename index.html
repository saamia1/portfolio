						  <h3>30MFF Website</h3>
						  <p>
							I built a full HTML/CSS website themed around sustainability — a cause I feel strongly about. The site featured a self-shot video showcasing student life at NYUAD and highlighting simple actions to save energy. I also developed a mini game to encourage interactive learning, and included an image carousel with custom-designed posters promoting awareness. One of my favorite parts of the project was doing voiceovers for inanimate objects in the video — a surprisingly challenging task that taught me how hard it is to match dialogue naturally with scene context and timing.

						  <h3>Interactive Comic</h3>
						  <p>
							This team project was an interactive comic titled <em>"Tux Saves the Day… or Not."</em> The story follows Tux, a superhero penguin, faced with a moral dilemma at an overcrowded penguin pond. A hungry Baby Penguin ventures into a bear’s territory in search of food, triggering a tense standoff. The reader is invited to decide whether Tux intervenes to help or walks away — shaping the outcome of the story. Through simple animations and branching panels, the comic explores themes of empathy, power dynamics, and survival. I contributed to both story development and implementation, and learned how to balance narrative with interactivity.

						  <h3>Sound Project</h3>
						  <p>
							This team project explored storytelling through sound, using only audio cues to build atmosphere and tension. Our story follows a girl alone in her home, studying peacefully when she’s startled by the sound of a bottle falling in the kitchen. As she cautiously searches the house—calling for her mom and hearing only silence—the suspense builds, until she finally discovers the source: her playful cat. We leaned into a spooky theme for this piece, which was a creative challenge and a genre shift from our usual work. Crafting the emotions purely through ambient sound and pacing was a uniquely immersive experience.

						  <h3>Video Project</h3>
						  <p>
							In this final team project, I took on multiple roles — lead actor, co-director, audio recorder, voice-over artist, and video editor. The film follows the journey of a wide-eyed freshman who starts university full of excitement, only to struggle with Computer Science and question her path. The story branches into two endings: one where she remains stuck in a cycle of academic burnout, and another where she rediscovers her love for music and rises to stardom. I helped shape the entire narrative, and editing the emotional beats of both endings was one of the most rewarding parts of the process.
